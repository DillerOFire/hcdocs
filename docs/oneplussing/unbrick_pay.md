# OnePlus Unbrick guide (PAID)

## Praparations

Prepare your puter to fluuuush:

- Please care to check your device region (Ace - chinese and it's PKGM, CPH is indian and it's 10r)
- For ace variant consider to use OFP_ColorOS a.06 which is 19G
- Download [OFP](https://firmwarex.net/download/pgkm10domestic_11_a-06_2022041601330378/#) (PKGM - Ace variant)
You can also get OFP [there](https://yun.daxiaamu.com/OnePlus_Roms/%E4%B8%80%E5%8A%A0OnePlus%20Ace/) (ColorOS PKGM for Ace and OxygenOS CPH for 10r)
- It's recomended to use download manager, as speed can be really slow for 20GB
- Install [Oplus Drivers](https://sfire.pw/Oppo-USB-Driver-Setup-V3.1.9.1.zip)
- Get [FTGUI](https://sfire.pw/FTGUIDev.exe)
- Download [gapro login tool](https://www.gaprologin.com) and place exe file inside folder with FTGUI
- Connect your device to pc by usb cable
- Get in COM by rebooting and hodling *vol-down* and *vol-up* button
- Check if device is available in device manager like this:

- If there's no your device then use official usb cable or check if all drivers are installed
- Extract OFP somewhere.

## le unbricking

After your preparation you can finally flash the device but the only problem left is OTP for gapro so to get it:

use official resellers (be aware of minimal deposit and price)
- https://3gsm.ru/ for ru
- https://easy-unlocker.com/ for other idk mb there's something better, do your own research

contact on tg for help:
- [@VerpaSRP](https://t.me/VerpaSRP) me and I can be busy and won't help

After you got OTP for gapro reproduce these steps:
- Check if FTGUI opens on auth page
- Open gapro tool, select Oneplus service and area for your device (ig "other area", but if it doesn't work try others)
- After you get into FTGUI, import OFP folder and press flash button
- Keep everything by default
- After FTGUI prepared, connect your device, hold all buttons and tool will flash automatically.

## Some things you can try
